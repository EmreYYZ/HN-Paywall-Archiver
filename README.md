# HN Paywall Archive

NodeJS script to submit latest HackerNews posts to Archive.is

Archive.today doesn't have a public API or anything that makes programatically archiving websites easier. At least this is what I thought before finding some code bits on Github and eventually this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_archive.today). If I didn't see this, I was going to use Puppeteer which was my initial plan. Everything is too easy now, I kinda feel down.
